# Neural-style-transfer-using-Pytorch  
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take three images, a content image, a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style — and blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style image.  
# Requirements  
1.Convolutional Neural Netwroks  
2. Pytorch framework.  
The test will run for 2000 steps which will take approximately 20-30min in GPU or Colab.
